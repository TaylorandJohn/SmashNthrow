# SmashNthrow
HTST 9832b Final Project
Our final project is based off of the medieval catapult, built using Vex robotics materials. 
The flight, velocity, and aim of the object being thrown is adjustable using elastic bands secured to the frame.
This object can be used as a tool to study projectile physics or can be examined by students to gain an appreciation for medieval technology. 
The basis of our design was using methods similar to ones available in medieval times, though the materials were much more modern.
